## 🔑 Key Environmental Factors

### 1. Global Oil Prices ⛽

**How It Works:**
- Higher oil prices → Increased costs for transportation, manufacturing, utilities

  - Higher delivery costs
  - Compressed margins
  - May pass costs to consumers

- ❌ **Manufacturing** (TCM, HPG, HSG)
  - Energy-intensive production
  - Higher operating costs

**Investment Strategy:**
```
Oil Price Rising:
→ BUY: GAS, PLX, PVD, BSR
→ SELL/AVOID: VJC, HVN, VNL, GMD

Oil Price Falling:
→ SELL: Oil & Gas stocks
→ BUY: Airlines, Logistics, Manufacturing
```

### 2. Interest Rates 💰

**How It Works:**

→ REDUCE: Bank exposure
```

### 3. USD/VND Exchange Rate 💱

**How It Works:**
- Weaker VND (higher USD/VND) → Good for exporters, bad for importers

```

### 6. Inflation Rate 📈

**How It Works:**

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Diversification Across Factors

**Don't concentrate in factor-sensitive stocks:**

**Bad Portfolio:**
```
100% Airlines (VJC, HVN)
→ Extremely vulnerable to oil shocks
```

**Good Portfolio:**
```
25% Banks (interest rate play)
25% Technology (export growth)
25% Consumer (domestic demand)
25% Commodities (inflation hedge)
→ Balanced across factors
```

### Factor Hedging

**Natural Hedges:**
- Hold both oil producers AND oil consumers
- Hold both exporters AND importers
- Hold both rate-sensitive AND rate-beneficiaries

**Example Hedged Portfolio:**
```
10% GAS (oil producer)
10% VJC (oil consumer)
→ Oil price changes have muted impact
```

### Monitoring Frequency

**Daily:**
- Check alerts
- Major news events
- Significant price moves

**Weekly:**
- Review factor changes
- Update factor view
- Adjust if needed

**Monthly:**
